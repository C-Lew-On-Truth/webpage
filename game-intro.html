          Working with media technology has given me a lot of opportunites and opened my eyes
          to various skills like software development! In fact, I created this web-profile myself!
          If you have some extra time on your hands, check out my GitHub project! 
          It's a quiz that test your knowledge on rap music! I wrote this website with HTML, 
          CSS, and JavaScript! This project was pretty difficult to make, but it was a 
          lot of fun when everything started coming together! Try it out if you think you have 
          the skills! 
        </p>
        <h1 class='header2'>GOOD LUCK!</h1>
