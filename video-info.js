 This was my first video production ever made, but one of my favorites! 
 This production took place during my junior year at Buffalo State College.
 The assignment was to pick a word out of a hat and make a video
 about it. I had choose the word "reconnoiter" which
 means to make a military observation. I felt it was only fitting
 to turn my college campus into a top flight security miliary base that we planned on 
 invading! It was strictly fiction! Hope you enjoy!

`
  This is a video I did for my senior project in College! It was based on a local
  skateshop in Buffalo, New York called Sunday! I had a lot of of fun creating this 
  piece especially because I've always been into skateboarding! It was a great experience
  learning about how a local skateshop can positively influence the youth in the community!

`
  This project was completed during my time at News Channel 4 WIVB Buffalo. My supervisor
  offered me the opportunity to create a demo package like the professional sports reporters who worked there.
  I found out very quickly how hard it was to be in front of the camera! Although my interest in media
  is focused behind the scenes, I am still not afraid to step up!

`
  One of my most recent projects! I decided to do a feature on one of my long time chef friends! 
  He has over 10 years of experience in the industry including running some restaurants in the NYC area!
  I wanted this video to have a rugged feel but rest assured, the cooking skills are still very clear!
  This is not your average cooking video, but I still consider it a classic! Hope you enjoy!
